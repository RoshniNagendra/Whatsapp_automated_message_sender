# Whatsapp_automated_message_sender
This was made for a club I'm heading. It is a selenium script that automates sending messages in whatsapp to a recipient of choice at a scheduled time. As students, we are quite busy. I was unable to engage an active community of over 200 students with a riddle every alternate day in a manual fashion. So, I built this.

Technologies used: python, selenium, chrome drivers
